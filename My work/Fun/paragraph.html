<h1>Introduction to Data Science</h1>
    <p>In a world of data space where organizations deal with petabytes and exabytes of data, the era of Big Data emerged, the essence of its storage also grew.
         It was a great challenge and concern for industries for the storage of data until 2010. Now when frameworks like Hadoop and others solved the problem of storage, the focus shifted to processing of data.
         Data Science plays a big role here. All those fancy Sci-fi movies you love to watch around can turn into reality by Data Science.
         Nowadays it’s growth has been increased in multiple ways and thus one should be ready for our future by learning what it is and how can we add value to it. Without any hunches, let’s dive into the world of Data Science.
         After touching to slightest idea, you might have ended up with many questions like What is Data Science? Why we need it? How can I be a Data Scientist?? etc?
         So let’s clear out ourselves from this baffle.</p>
    <p>Data science is a field that involves using statistical and computational techniques to extract insights and knowledge from data.
         It encompasses a wide range of tasks, including data cleaning and preparation, data visualization, statistical modeling, machine learning, and more.
         Data scientists use these techniques to discover patterns and trends in data, make predictions, and support decision-making.
         They may work with a variety of data types, including structured data (such as numbers and dates in a spreadsheet) and unstructured data (such as text, images, or audio).
         Data science is used in a wide range of industries, including finance, healthcare, retail, and more.</p>
    <p>Data science is a multidisciplinary field that uses statistical and computational methods to extract insights and knowledge from data.
         It involves a combination of skills and knowledge from various fields such as statistics, computer science, mathematics, and domain expertise.

         The process of data science involves several steps, including data collection, cleaning, exploration, analysis, and interpretation.
         These steps are often iterative, and the process may be refined based on the results obtained.
